# Water Quality Analysis using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms
## Done As A part of Course Project For Soft Computing

## Deep Predictive approach for Smart Environment using Neural Network
## Use of Genetic Algorithm to get maximium efficiency parameters for water quality prediction
### The parameters are
* nb_neurons
* nb_layers
* activation function: relu, elu, tanh, sigmoid
* optimizer: rmsprop, adam, adagrad, adadelta, adamax

### Steps In Execution
* Data is divided into training and testing data
* Initialy a random combination of Parameters is choosen
* Neural Network is generated based on the parameters
* Neural network is trained and tested accuracy is noted
* based on accuracy the parameters is changed and goto step 2
* after 10 steps the best accuracy parameters and accuracy is logged
